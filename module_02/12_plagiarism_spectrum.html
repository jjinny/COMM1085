              <p>Copied sources are often easily apparent because the writer has neglected to modify punctuation or capitalization. Also, when text is copied from an online source, the font or the size of the text may not be changed to match the rest of the paper.</p>
              <p>Also, it’s important to notice how the focus is out of balance here. It’s not helpful to focus so closely on the details provided in this copied text, i.e., exactly how many job categories were studied.

                    <p><em><u class="text-second">Out of 702</u> job categories examined <u class="text-second">in the Oxford study, 47 per cent were</u> deemed <u class="text-second">possible candidates for some</u> degree <u class="text-second">of future automation. The</u> shift <u class="text-second">is being</u> driven <u class="text-second">by technological advancements in key areas where computers have</u> typically lagged <u class="text-second">humans. One is perception. Thanks to</u> improved <u class="text-second">sensor technology, engineers are now able to build robots that are capable of</u> functioning <u class="text-second">outside of</u> strictly controlled <u class="text-second">environments, such as factories. Google’s driverless car, for example, relies on a combination of GPS, lasers, radar and sophisticated software to help it</u> plot its course <u class="text-second">and avoid obstacles along the way.</u></u>

              <h3>Why it doesn't work</h3>
              <p>This kind of writing often becomes disorienting and incomprehensible, as the words that are chosen to replace the original words tend to distort the original meaning of the text.</p>
