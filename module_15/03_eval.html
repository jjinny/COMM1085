				    <ol>
					    <p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">1</span>Read again the assigned article from Part One of the assignment.</p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">2</span>Write 250-300 words and use evidence from the text to answer <strong>one</strong> of the following questions.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Do you agree with the author’s point of view? Explain why or why not. Use examples from the article and from your own experience.</li>
							<li>How did reading the article make you feel?  Explain why, referring to specific parts of the article.</li>
							<li>How effectively did the writer support her main argument? As you develop your response, you might focus on her use of one particular kind of support, or you might explore a few strategies used in the article. Examples of supporting strategies include facts, definitions, quotations, examples, stories, or comparison. Remember, your focus here is to argue that she does or doesn’t effectively support her main argument; in order to do this well, you’ll need to support your own position with examples from the text and explanations of how these examples reinforce your interpretation.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">3</span>Use paragraph structure to organize and develop your response. This may include multiple paragraphs.<br>
						<ul>
							<li>The same points with respect to writing and grading identified in step 3 apply to this step as well.</li>
							<li>Notice that you are asked to paraphrase the thesis, which means present the author’s thesis in your own words.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">4</span>Review the rubric (available below and in the submission folder for this assignment). Part Two will be assessed using a holistic rubric, which means that you will be assessed according to the overall effectives of your response, rather than assign a specific number of points to individual components. This holistic assessment might take into account the following characteristics: organization, vocabulary, use of transitions, originality, support, grammar and mechanics, and following assignment instructions.</p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">5</span>Be sure to read over your work carefully before you send it off to your professor, so you can check that your ideas read as clearly on the page as they sounded in your head.</p>
