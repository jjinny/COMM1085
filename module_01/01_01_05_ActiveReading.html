      <h2>Active Reading</h2>
      
      <p class="lead">Have you ever sat down to read a chapter in a textbook, determined to soak it all in, only to find your eyelids drooping after a couple of pages?</p>
      
      <p>Have you ever found yourself glancing at the clock, shocked to discover that you’ve spent the last 15 minutes reading the same sentence paragraph — and it’s just not sinking in?</p>

      <p>Or maybe you’ve experienced this: with your highlighter at the ready, you begin to read the article that’s been assigned for class this week; only before long you realize you’ve highlighted so much of the first page that it’s wet and mostly yellow?</p>

      <!--Card Primary-->
      <div class="card accent-4 z-depth-2">
        <div class="card-block">
          <p class="white-text">If these situations sound familiar, you’re in good company; these frustrations are common. Why? Because too often we attempt to read our textbooks, articles, and reports — the things we have to read for school and work — the same way we would read something for pleasure, like a magazine, or a novel, or a website.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>When we read for pleasure, we want to be entertained, so it’s appropriate to let the text do all of the work and transport us to another time and place. But when we are reading for meaning — when we need to absorb and use the information delivered by the text — then we need to read in a different way. We need to use active reading strategies.</p>

      <p>As the name suggests, these strategies require us to be active in our search for meaning, asking questions of what we read, making notes as we go. In this style of reading, the reader is in charge of the process, which means that you can read sections out of order, go back and forth between sections, and focus on key areas.</p>

      <h4>There are two key parts of active reading: skimming and scanning. We will explore each technique in turn.</h4>
