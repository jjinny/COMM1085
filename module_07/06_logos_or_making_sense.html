      <p>Using <em>logos</em> to support your argument means that you are attempting to convince your reader that your argument makes sense, that it “adds up”. This approach can be successful when you present your reader with factual information— as opposed to your personal preferences — and logical interpretations of that information.</p>
      <p>This logical approach — factual information and logical interpretation — might take one or more of the following seven forms (Wood & Miller, 2014, pp. 185-196): <ul>
      	<li>Signs</li>
      	<li>Induction</li>
      	<li>Cause</li>
      	<li>Deduction</li>
      	<li>Analogies</li>
      	<li>Definition</li>
      	<li>Statistics</li>
      </ul></p>

                <p>Supporting your argument with inductive reasoning is similar to supporting your argument on the basis of a sign. But with inductive reasoning you reach a conclusion after observing multiple and repeated examples or events. For example, an Early Childhood Educator (ECE) might look at research that shows <a href="http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/kindergarten/theresearchisin.html" target="_blank">students enrolled in full-day kindergarten are more prepared for Grade 1 in all areas used to measure early development <i class="fal fa-external-link text-third" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> and conclude that Ontario’s adoption of full-day kindergarten was a wise decision. The research study uses induction to come to the conclusion used by the ECE.</p>

                <p>This method of support draws on the cause-and-effect logic that we explored in Week 4 <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=159769&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=Conestoga-1318680" target="_self">Causal and Effect Analyses</a>. Here, the author attempts to justify their argument by considering either the causes or the consequences of a specific event or decision. </p>
                <p>For example, the argument that “provinces and municipal school boards should offer more hands-on and technical skills courses at the secondary level” becomes more convincing if the author can establish a number of positive outcomes, such as:
                <ol type="a">
                	<li>that this policy will encourage young Canadians to pursue trades-focused post-secondary programs, and </li>
                	<li>that this policy will allow them to enter their programs and apprenticeships with more advanced skills.</li>
                </ol>By establishing a clear link between the proposal and the outcome of that proposal, the reader is more to likely to support the writer’s position.</p>

                <p>In this style of reasoning, the author uses a general principle — something that everyone can agree is true — to draw a conclusion about a particular situation that is still unresolved. This conclusion doesn’t necessarily need to be indisputable; it just needs to seem like the conclusion that anyone would reasonably draw from the same set of circumstances.</p>
                <p>Let’s take, for example, the argument that post-secondary professors should use apps that allow students to participate in class discussions with their smartphones. One might support this argument with the following deduction:

                	<li>When students use their smartphones they are more interested and engaged<br>Therefore,</li>

                <p>An analogy allows you to strengthen or support your argument by drawing on the strength of something that your reader is more familiar with. You can reduce your reader’s confusion or skepticism about your argument by comparing it to a situation that they already understand or accept.</p>
                <p>There are three different kinds of analogies:
                <ul>
                	<li>Historical analogies<br>This kind of analogy uses an example of something similar that has happened in the past to support your claim about will happen in the future. For example, “Decades from now, Canada’s Sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) will be remembered as an important moment in our country’s history, just as 1967’s Centennial celebrations are appreciated today.”</li>
                	<li>Literal analogies<br>These are direct comparisons between items that belong to the same category. For example, “Now that Canada Goose has become a publicly traded company, it is poised to become a global leader in the outerwear market. Investors should look to the success of Lulu Lemon, another Canadian clothing company that turned local success into a global brand.”</li>
                	<li>Figurative analogies<br>This kind of comparison requires the reader to use their imagination a little. Whereas a literal analogy draws an obvious comparison between items or ideas that are similar by definition, a figurative analogy draws an unexpected comparison between two items or ideas; although one wouldn’t normally put these two things together, the comparison is still logical because there is some quality that they share.<br>For example, let’s take the argument that North American tour operators should share profits with the local economies of the places they visit. The writer of this argument might support their claim by drawing a comparison to common etiquette: when you visit someone’s house for dinner, you make sure to bring something for the host.</li>

              <div class="card-block">
                <p>This kind of support strengthens an argument by illustrating that a particular instance meets or fails to meet the established criteria of a general category.</p>
                <p>For example, let’s consider the topic of “gamification” in learning — the strategy of using video game design and game elements in educational contexts, like curriculum planning and classroom lessons. If you were to claim that educators should reject this approach, you might try to use the definitions of “education” and “game” to claim that the two are not compatible: “Education is the process of systematic instruction, while games are defined by play and competition.”</p>

                <p>Statistics provide information in a numerical form. They offer readers a detailed and often undeniable understanding of what is real or true. Moreover, statistics can strengthen an argument by emphasizing the degree or extent of a claim.</p>
                <p>For example, it might be more compelling to cite a poll that says 90% of Canadians support a particular policy than to simply say that the policy is popular.</p>
