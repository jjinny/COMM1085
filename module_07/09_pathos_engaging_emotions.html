        <p>If you understand who your audience is — what they value, what they care about, what they want — you can write in a way that makes your readers feel a particular way: e.g. <ul>
        	<li>anger</li>
        	<li>sadness</li>
        	<li>sympathy</li>
        	<li>ambition</li>

        <p>Emotions have a strong influence on us. Savvy writers know this and may aim to trigger a particular emotion in order to influence your position on a topic or decision. Three writing strategies or techniques are particularly effective in targeting a reader’s emotions:<ul>
        	<li>Narration: Telling a story makes an abstract argument more realistic</li>
        	<li>Description: Placing (surrounding?) the reader in a moment or scene by providing sensory details</li>
        	<li>Evocative language: Using a series of emotionally powerful words or phrases to build a sense of mood or “emotional landscape”</li>
        </ul></p>

                <p>One way to make your position more convincing for readers is to support your argument with anecdotes, examples of real people in real situations. Reading detailed and dramatic stories can trigger our emotions in various ways: <ul>
                	<li>We sympathize with the people in the story.</li>
                	<li>We can imagine ourselves in the other person’s place places.</li>
                	<li>We can understand how these issues might play out in the real world, as opposed to a statistic or a theory.</li>
                	<li>Stories can remind us of situations we’ve been in or alert us to situations that we might find ourselves in. </li>

						<p>Notice how this writer, a doctor who is encouraging the public to support poverty reduction as a way to improve public health, uses narration to make his argument more specific and compelling:</p>
						<p class="pl-4 pr-4">As a family physician, I see the health effects of poverty on a daily basis. One of my patients, "Sally," is a 37-year-old single woman working at a full-time minimum wage job in Toronto that provides her with $1,280 a month (and no benefits), $450 below the Statistics Canada poverty line.</p>
						<p class="pl-4 pr-4">She is currently healthy, but studies have shown that her poverty places her at a 300 per cent higher risk of developing diabetes and a 200 per cent higher risk of having a major episode of depression. Her risk of developing heart disease is about the same as if she had high blood pressure or was a smoker (both conditions into which we have pumped millions of health-care dollars for prevention). Her life expectancy is 1 1/2 years shorter, and her risk of dying from a chronic disease is 16 per cent higher per year than the average Canadian.</p>

                <p>Another way to lead your readers to an emotional response is to discuss your topic using emotionally loaded language. Compare these two passages about what we really mean when we speak about a “good” job.</p>

					<p>Money cannot be the sole or primary standard for successful employment. Job satisfaction and happiness have to be considered an equally important factor. Proof of this claim is everywhere in modern North American society: in post-secondary schools, where adult learners seek re-training after an unhappy first career; in offices and factories, where job satisfaction surveys measure high rates of discontentment; in newspapers and movies, where individuals who follow their dream job are celebrated and admired.</p>

                <div class="col col-sm-7 z-depth-1 pr-3 pl-3 pt-3 pb-0 mb-3">
                    <p>Definitions of career success that rely upon <strong>the almighty dollar</strong> are as <strong>dangerous</strong> as they are <strong>misleading</strong>, <strong>dooming</strong> countless of millions to an unfulfilling end. But <strong>the lure of wealth</strong> is powerful, especially when it’s been <strong>force-fed</strong> to us in our youth. Instead, we need to teach people when they’re young that job satisfaction and overall happiness are the <u>treasures</u> one should seek. Proof of this claim is everywhere in modern North American society: in the <u>passion and enthusiasm</u> of adult learners who have returned to pursue the career they <u>truly desired</u> in the first place; in the <strong>boredom</strong> of the cubicle and the <strong>monotony</strong> of the assembly line; and in the myths that we build around those <u>heroic</u> few who have <u>broken free</u> from their golden handcuffs and <u>pursued their dreams</u>.</p>

             <p>The language in the first example is relatively neutral, emphasizing a rational consideration of the claim. The other example uses a series of emotionally loaded words and phrases to colour one side of the argument in gloom (in <strong>boldface</strong>) and the other side in hope (<u>underlined</u>). </p>
