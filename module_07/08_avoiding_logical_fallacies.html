      <h1>Avoiding Logical Fallacies</h1>
      <p>Logic and reason can provide the backbone of support for an argument. But when the logic of an argument is flawed, it can be said that person has made a logical “fallacy”.</p>
      <p>Fallacies are often committed unintentionally, the result of careless or hasty thinking. However, it’s also possible for people to present logical fallacies knowingly. They might present their audience with phony logic and hope that the audience will be swayed by something that bears the appearance of logic.</p>
      <p>Why is it important to know the difference between a logical argument and a logical fallacy? On the one hand, you want to create the strongest argument possible to defend your thesis. Creating a fallacy – even unintentionally – makes your argument weaker. On the other hand, you want to identify an argument against your position that seems strong, but, in fact, uses a logical fallacy. Finally, the ability to judge the quality of arguments increases your credibility (ethos).</p>
      <p><em>Learn more about various logical fallacies by reading through the following scenarios.</em></p>

      <p>You are writing a paper that argues that Canada has well-crafted laws prohibiting hate speech, but greater enforcement is needed in the modern Internet era. You have found a source that claims enforcing the prohibition of hate speech on the internet is wrong because such prohibition is widespread censorship, and it would eliminate Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees such freedoms as thought, belief, opinion and expression.</p>
      <p>Does the source provide a logical argument?</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The correct answer is no. The source’s argument is an example of a <em>Strawman Fallacy</em>. The source has oversimplified the concept of enforcing hate speech laws and replaced it with censorship. The argument has been changed to attacking full censorship instead of the original idea.</p>
                <p>If you choose to address this source in your paper as a different interpretation of the issue, you would want to show how the source has introduced new terms. One way to address this is to emphasize definitions and the key terms under examination.</p>

      <p>You are writing a paper that argues eSports should be respected as a legitimate sport equal to major professional sports like hockey and soccer. You have found a source that argues the opposite position. You cite the source in your paper, claiming that the author is simply resentful of this new trend because they are old and probably bad at video games as well.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The correct answer is no. The reasoning you have used in your marketing campaign is an example of a <em>Faulty Causality</em> fallacy. It incorrectly assumes that since 'B' occurred after 'A' then 'A' must have caused 'B.' Just because one event occurs along with or after another event, does not mean that the first event caused the second event to occur.</p>

                <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The correct answer is no. Your argument relies upon the <em>Slippery Slope</em> fallacy. It assumes that an independent or relatively harmless decision will inevitably lead to an overwhelmingly negative outcome. This kind of argument is flawed when the chain of events between the initial decision and the final outcome is based only on speculation and impossible to confirm. However, it can be convincing because it often appeals to people’s fears and anxieties.</p>
