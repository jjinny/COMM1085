      <h1>Ethos, or Establishing Credibility</h1>
      
      
      <p>The principle of “ethos” is fairly simple: our readers are more likely to accept our argument if they respect us as a person who is qualified to be part of the conversation. So, how then do we establish this credibility with the reader? We can demonstrate the following characteristics:
      <ul>
      	<li>Knowledge</li>
      	<li>Reliability</li>
      	<li>Fairness</li>
      </ul>To learn more about how you can demonstrate each to establish your credibility with the reader, click the title.</p>

                <p>One way to establish your credibility with the audience is to present yourself as someone who is intimately familiar with the topic. Think of it like a password or a secret handshake – your reader may be wary of someone who is claiming to know what’s right, so you may need to demonstrate that you’re qualified to participate in the argument.</p>
                <p>Your knowledge can come from first-hand experience or from second-hand research.</p>
				<h4>First-hand Experience</h4>
				<p>Sharing first-hand experience is one effective way to establish credibility with readers. If you possess an insider’s perspective, your reader will likely accept that you are qualified to take a position on the topic.</p>
				<p>This first-hand experience perspective may have come from a variety of sources:
				<ul>
				  <li>Being a practicing member of a profession or industry</li>
				  <li>Belonging to a community that is based on a hobby or interest </li>
				  <li>Belonging to a community that is based on geographical location or national/ethnic identity   </li>
				  <li>Having been affected emotionally or financially by the issue </li>
				  <li>Having witnessed or participated in a specific event</li>
				</ul></p>
				<h4>Second-hand Research</h4>
				<p>First-hand experience is not the only way to demonstrate that you have the knowledge necessary to speak convincingly on the topic. Second-hand research can provide you with much of the information that your reader would expect an insider to have.</p>
				<p>Second-hand research can display your knowledge by showing, for example:
				<ul>
					<li>The names of experts on the topic or other key people related to the topic </li>
					<li>The most relevant history related to the current topic </li>
					<li>The most recent developments related to the topic </li>
					<li>An understanding of the consequences or implications of the issue</li>
				</ul></p>

                <p>Your reader will be more likely to accept your overall message if you can demonstrate that you are a trustworthy source of information. Readers might question the legitimacy of your entire argument if the information you present is not accurate, current, and relevant.</p>
                <p>The best way to present yourself as a reliable source of information is to use credible sources. We’ll explore credibility of sources in greater detail during Weeks 9 and 10, but for now here are the key factors to consider when determining whether your source is reliable and credible.</p>
                <h4>Author</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the author's name provided? Is the author's contact information available?</li>
                    <li>Does the author have credentials that make him or her qualified to speak on this subject?</li>
                    <li>Can you easily find other things that the author has written?</li>
                    <li>Does the author have any affiliation that would make their writing less reliable?</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Publication source</h4>
                <p>For example: newspaper, magazine, website</p>
                <ul>
					<li>How does the source describe itself? Does it have an “about” page (if online)?</li>
					<li>Does it provide information about how big of an organization it is – how many people read it, how many people work for it? </li>
					<li>Is it owned by another company?</li>
					<li>Can you tell how they make money, e.g., by selling ads, promoting products, or charging subscription fees?</li>
					<li>Have you heard of the publication before? What is its reputation if you do a search for it? </li>
				</ul>
                <h4>Publication date</h4>
                <ul>
					<li>Is a publication date provided? </li>
					<li>Is it current?</li>          		
                </ul>
                <h4>Information</h4>
                <ul>
					<li>Does the information seem plausible? </li>
					<li>Is the source of the information cited? </li>
					<li>Can you confirm the information by checking for it in another source?</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

                                                                   href="#collapseThree" aria-expanded="false"
                                                                   aria-controls="collapseThree">

                <p>Finally, you can gain credibility with your reader by acknowledging that your position on the topic is not the only one. In Week 6 we introduced the idea that an argument needs to be debatable. If it’s not, we observed, then your position is not truly an argument. Acknowledging the other side of the debate is an effective way to build trust with your readers. By including and addressing opposing ideas, you can establish your intention to participate in a fair and open debate, which you intend to win on the merits of your argument. To build this trust with your reader, you must present opposing ideas accurately, without misrepresenting them in a way that would favour your own position.</p>
                <p>However, you are not expected to present these opposing perspectives without challenging them. You might use one or more of the following techniques to challenge opposing arguments fairly (Norton, Green & Dynes, 2015, p. 197): <ul>
                	<li>Suggest that part of the argument is irrelevant or minor</li>
                	<li>Claim that the argument is based on a special or isolated case and does not apply to the wider issue</li>
                	<li>Claim that the argument is focused on only one aspect and overlooks something else that is crucial</li>
                	<li>Claim that the argument emphasizes short-term considerations and pays insufficient attention to the long-term implications (or vice versa)</li>
                	<li>Accept parts of the opposing argument (e.g. an interpretation or a proposal) but add to / expand on / improve it with your own contributions     </li>
                </ul></p>
