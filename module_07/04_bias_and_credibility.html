        <h1><i class="fal fa-puzzle-piece text-second fa-lg fa-pull-left"></i>Bias and Credibility</h1>
        <p>When people suggest that an argument is biased, they are likely suggesting that the argument is unfair and should be rejected because the person making the argument is only capable of looking at the topic from one limited perspective.</p>
        <p>Bias is a way of looking at a situation, person, group, etc., through the lens of personal preferences, relationships, stereotypes, and affiliations rather than an objective analysis. In fact, almost all arguments include at least some bias because, after all, we all see the world through our own eyes and our own set of experiences. Such bias can affect your credibility if it leads you to overlook important information or other points of view.</p>
        <p>Therefore, we need to acknowledge our <strong>personal perspectives</strong> in order to prevent a <strong>bias</strong> that affects our credibility with our audience.</p>
        <p>Think of the many factors that might have an influence on the things you care about, the things you value:</p>
        <div class="row">
        	<div class="col-sm-4"><ul>
        		<li>gender</li>
        		<li>age</li>
        		<li>nationality</li>
        		<li>language</li>
        	</ul></div>
        	<div class="col-sm-4"><ul>
        		<li>education</li>
        		<li>ethnicity</li>
        		<li>religion</li>
        		<li>job</li>
        	</ul></div>
        	<div class="col-sm-4"><ul>
        		<li>socio-economic position</li>
        		<li>cultural traditions </li>
        	</ul></div>
        </div>
        <p>Even if we prevent these factors from completely shaping our argument, they still are likely to influence our sense of what’s important or what’s right and wrong. </p>

                <p>It’s impossible to eliminate all traces of our subjective experience; instead of trying, we can try to make them more visible to ourselves and our reader. There are two ways we can do this: explicitly and implicitly.</p>

						    <h4>Acknowledging bias implicitly </h4>
							<p>Even if we don’t have a direct relationship or connection to the topic we’re discussing, our perspective might guide our research on the topic. This influence might lead us to instinctively seek out perspectives that reinforce our own.</p>
							<p>To counteract this instinct, strategically seek out a wide range of voice and perspectives. Presenting your reader with a variety of perspectives can reduce the impact of your own bias and signal to your reader that you are making an effort to be objective. We will talk about this more in week 9.</p>

				<p>Referring to yourself in the first-person in the context of these “thinking” verbs is acceptable in persuasive writing, because you won’t lose credibility with the reader.

        <p class="mt-4">If a reader perceives that the writer’s bias has overwhelmed the argument, they are less likely to take the writer or the argument seriously. It’s a reasonable reaction, similar to the one we all might have if we suspect that we are playing a game with somebody who’s cheating, or if we were buying vegetables at the grocery store and we realized the check-out clerk was putting his thumb on the scale to drive up the cost of the purchase.</p>
        <p>If, on the other hand, the writer can acknowledge the limitations of his or her own perspective and look beyond them, then there is no reason to doubt the author’s credibility — the argument should still be evaluated on the merits of its logic and persuasive power.</p>
