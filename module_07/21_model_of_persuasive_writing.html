		  <p>To the decision-makers and game-changers at Tim Hortons: I am writing to propose an improvement to the “Roll Up The Rim” promotion your coffee company is currently running. As you may be aware, coffee is the number one beverage of choice in Canada (Coffee Facts, 2016, para 1). Canadians may love their coffee, but nobody likes losing; and one thing that frequently leaves a bitter aftertaste is rolling up the rim to see “Please Play Again”. <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The introductory paragraph is effective because it establishes a specific problem that the writer intends to resolve."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> I propose <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This use of the “thinking I” is credible because it is direct and professional."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> that you consider revising your existing rules to allow your customers the opportunity to trade in 5 “Please Play Again” cups (whole cups, not just tabs) in exchange for a free timbit. I believe <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Perhaps this use of the “feeling I” could have been removed. The sentence might have been more convincing if it began “This amendment will...”"><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> that this amendment will not only benefit your company, but your customers and the environment as well.</p>
		  <p>Your company is a model of success, and although your CEO may not be sitting in the board room agonizing over how to attract more customers, I do think he might want to consider how this promotion makes your existing customers feel. Happy customers are loyal customers, and by allowing them to redeem 5 otherwise losing cups to earn a free timbit, will not only ensure their taste buds are tickled, it may help to form new dining habits that last long after the promotion is finished. When one considers the long-term advantages to this slight <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The writer is carefully choosing their words — slight adjustment, minor change — to make their proposal sound manageable."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> adjustment, it is almost certain that Tim Hortons will benefit from this minor change.</p>
		  <p>Your customer base also stands to benefit. <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This topic sentence is a good example of being concise. The direct approach would likely be appreciated by its intended audience, Tim Hortons executives."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> No longer will “Please Play Again” be followed by disappointment. Instead, your valuable customers will have a sense of ownership over their “win” because they will have the opportunity to work for it by collecting the required 5 cups in exchange for a timbit. It is a small shift that takes the sting out of a losing cup, and will make your customers feel like every cup has the potential to be a winner.</p>
		  <p>The environment will win as a result of these changes. Take a look around; Tim Horton’s coffee cups are a large source of litter in our cities, parks and highways. In addition, many municipalities do not currently offer recycling of coffee cups and many are forced to be sent to landfill instead of recycling facilities. (CBC News, 2016, para 1). <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The credibility of this argument is strengthened by these references to reliable news sources and the logical conclusions that the writer draws from them."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> If Tim Hortons salvaged even a small percentage of their coffee cups, these cups could then be sent to the proper facilities for recycling. </p>
		  <p>This simple change has the potential to make a big difference. Not only will your company benefit financially from the continued loyalty of your happy customers, the environment will be helped by the re-channelling of used cups to proper facilities for recycling. All this, for the cost of a .20 cent timbit, simply reconfirms that small things can create big changes.<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This conclusion is effective because it reinforces the cause and effect logic of the argument, while simultaneously appealing to the reader’s emotions."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
