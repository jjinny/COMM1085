      "Answer": "<p>Here are three possible ways to rewrite this paragraph:</p><p><strong>Solution 1:</strong><br>People who use transit are doing the rest of us a big favour. By riding on public transit instead of their own vehicles, they're reducing congestion, greenhouse gases and air pollution. We should be thanking them. Instead, they got a slap in the face when the federal government released the 2017 budget and took away the tax credit you got for buying a transit pass. If government officials really want to get people out of their cars, they just need to make it cheaper to use transit — and taxes are a powerful tool to change behaviour.</p><p><strong>Solution 2:</strong><br>Transit riders have a huge impact on society. By removing cars from the road, there is less congestion, greenhouse gases, and air pollution. Government policy should help out transit users, but the 2017 federal budget did the opposite when it got rid of the tax credit that allowed transit riders to claim the cost of their monthly passes. This policy change illustrates this government’s disregard for the people and issues they say they value: low-income earners, reducing gridlock, environmental sustainability. Government officials already have the financial incentives they need to reduce car trips and increase transit use. They simply need to use them.</p><p><strong>Solution 3:</strong><br>Transit riders contribute to society in significant and measurable ways. By removing cars from the road, they reduce congestion, greenhouse gases, and air pollution. Government policy should therefore encourage and reward transit users, but the 2017 federal budget achieved the opposite when it eliminated the tax credit that allowed transit riders to claim the cost of their monthly passes. This policy change illustrates this government’s disregard for the people and issues they claim to value: low-income earners, reducing gridlock, environmental sustainability. Government officials already possess the financial incentives they need to reduce car trips and increase transit use. They simply need to use them.</p>",
      "PrePopulated": "When I take the bus instead of my car, I’m making all kinds of contributions to society. I’m helping with traffic and the environment, for example, so I should be getting more appreciation. But, instead, I got the short end of the stick with this year’s federal budget. By taking away the tax credit that saved me a lot of money on my tax refund, the government is showing me that they don’t really mean what they say about helping students.",
