      <h1>Bias and Arguments</h1>
      <img src="images/bias_arguments.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1 pattern-1 mb-3" alt="">
      <p>Just as bias can undermine your credibility - <a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=Conestoga-1331184" target="_self">Bias and Credibility</a>, it can also undermine your reasoning or your entire argument. Bias can go beyond personal preference if it causes you to: <ul>
      	<li>overlook important information,</li>
      	<li>pre-judge people and situations unfairly, or</li>
      	<li>intentionally misrepresent the facts of the argument in order to strengthen the argument.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>In these outcomes, the argument is discredited because it appears the person making the argument is unwilling to or incapable of including alternative perspectives.</p>
      <div class="card-block rounded second-bg text-white z-depth-1 p-3 m-3">
      	<p>Let’s imagine this scenario: <br>A newspaper columnist reports that an elected official has been accused of misconduct. In response, the official claims that the columnist is biased against him and the party he belongs to. As proof, the official claims the columnist and the newspaper he writes for are affiliated with the official’s political adversaries.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, the elected official is using the word ‘biased’ to accuse the columnist of being unable or unwilling to fairly assess the claims that have been made against him. He’s implying that the columnist’s argument has one of the following flaws:<ul>
      	<li>Incomplete information: The columnist’s political affiliation has led him to see only a narrow and incomplete portion of the situation; </li>
      	<li>Prejudice: The columnist is so blindly loyal to his political party that he now unquestioningly accepts nasty rumours about his political opponents, or else simply assumes the worst of them; or, </li>
      	<li>Dishonesty: The columnist has compromised his integrity in order to support his political allies and is willing to misrepresent the situation if it will hurt his political opponents.</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>If any of these statements were true, they would indeed compel a reasonable observer to disregard the columnist’s argument. In other words, if the elected official could prove that the columnist had based his argument on incomplete information, prejudice, or outright dishonesty then the allegation of bias would be valid.</p>
      <p>Although these challenges are generally difficult to prove, we can use this scenario to better understand the kind of bias that many people are looking for when they are evaluating an argument.</p>
