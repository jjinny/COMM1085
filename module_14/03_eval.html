				        <p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1" >1</span>Read the assigned article in the next topic.</p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">2</span>Answer the following questions (steps 3 to 5) on “<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou={orgUnitId}&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=Conestoga-1317361" target="_self">Work Sheet for Final Assignment<i class="far fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> or on an original document. If you are not using the provided document, label your responses clearly.</p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">3</span>Identify the <strong>intended audience</strong> for the assigned article. Explain your reasoning. (4 points)<br>
						<ul>
							<li>This question is worth 20% of the Part One grade. It’s therefore reasonable to conclude that it is possible to successfully respond to these questions in 3-4 sentences.</li>
							<li>If you look at the rubric for this question, you will see that complete marks can only be awarded to responses that “<strong>correctly</strong> identify <strong>and</strong> explain” the text’s audience. You can access the rubric below in Evaluation or in the Submission Folder for this assignment.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">4</span>Paraphrase the <strong>thesis</strong> of the assigned article and explain how you identified it. (4 points)<br>
						<ul>
							<li>The same points with respect to writing and grading identified in step 3 apply to this step as well.</li>
							<li>Notice that you are asked to paraphrase the thesis, which means present the author’s thesis in your own words.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">5</span>Write a concise <strong>summary</strong> of the article (150-250 words), focusing only on the author’s main point and key supporting points. Include only ideas or information that is in the original text, and remember to use your own words. (12 points)<br>
						<ul>
							<li>This question is worth 12 points out of a total of 20. That means it is worth 60% of the Part One grade. You can therefore conclude that we are expecting a longer response here. As it is a summary, it should be approximately 1/3-1/4 the length of the original text.</li>
							<li>If you look at the rubric for this question, you will see that equal weight is assigned to all the criteria. You can access the rubric below in Evaluation or in the Submission Folder for this assignment.</li>
							</ul></p>
						<p><span class="circle-number accent-2 pull-left mr-2 mt-1">6</span>Be sure to read over your work carefully before you send it off to your professor, so you can check that your ideas read as clearly on the page as they sounded in your head.</p>
