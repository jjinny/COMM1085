Charlie Gillis (2016) discovered in a recent <em>Macleans</em> study that <strong>only 26% of Canadians support fully autonomous vehicles, and it is not hard to see why (para. 6)</strong>. The economics of self-driving cars are going to turn many industries on their heads, with 2.4 million workers from the trucking industry alone set to lose their jobs in the next ten to twenty years (Lee, 2015, para. 7). There have also been deaths caused by misjudgement on the part of the software, and as soon as the vehicle is responsible for the driving, it is easy to blame the software for the death of a driver. Clearly, the biggest obstacle faced by manufacturers of self-driving cars is not the technology itself; instead, it is getting consumers to trust the technology.</p></div>",
