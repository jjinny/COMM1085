          <h1>Reported Speech: A Summary</h1>

			<p>You may begin teaching reported speech at an intermediate level.  Reported speech has a number of subtle variations that you probably won’t touch on until your students are more advanced.</p>

			<h2>Basic Reported Speech:</h2>
			
			<p>When I tell you what someone else said without directly quoting, it is known as reported speech.  Let’s look at an example:</p>
			
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-sm-6 callout core03-bg" style="min-height: 180px;">
					<p><strong>The left column</strong> contains the sentences that the roving reporter, Hound Dog, wrote out in preparing to write her exposé about a contentious town hall meeting discussing Light Rail Transit.</p>		
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-6 callout primary-bg" style="min-height: 180px;">
					<p class="neutral04-clr"><strong>The right column</strong> of the following chart lists quotes from a Town Hall meeting which may or may not have been held in Waterloo Region prior to the commencement of building the light rail system.</p>		
				</div>
			</div>

			<table class="table table-bordered table-striped" summary="Examples of reported speech" id="reported-speech">
			 <tbody>
			  <tr>
			   <td width="50%">“LRT is good for Waterloo Region,” said a city counsellor.</td>
			   <td>A city counsellor said that LRT was good for Waterloo Region.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			   <td>“We are moving toward sustainable development,” another counsellor reminded the audience.</td>
			   <td>Another city counsellor reminded the audience that they were moving toward sustainable development.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			   <td>“There was not enough consultation,” one citizen said.</td>
			   <td>One citizen said that there had not been enough consultation.</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
			   <td>“The Region was not paying attention to its citizens during the planning stages”, the citizen emphasized.</td>
			   <td>The citizen emphasized that the Region had not been paying attention to its citizens during the planning stages.</td>
			  </tr>
