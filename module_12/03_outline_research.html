      <p>The outline you prepare should include all of the information and ideas that your final paper will need, but it shouldn’t be written in the same style as your final paper. Instead of linking together sentences and paragraphs, you will use a condensed version of writing called “point-form” style. This style is likely familiar to you as the style that you use to take notes in class. It’s a helpful way to write quickly without sacrificing any important meaning.</p>
      <p>We will see this week how an outline contains all the major details that lead ultimately to a research paper. Look at the comparison between the writing in this outline and the way the same ideas are represented in the final paper.</p>

                <p>Canadians love donuts, and have demonstrated a passion for the holey treat unrivalled by the rest of the world. In a market so promising for the sugary snack, Krispy Kreme, one of the world’s preeminent Donut superpowers, would have no trouble setting up shop and finding sustainable success, right?

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Why Original Expansion Failed</h3>
                <p>The story of Krispy Kreme’s failed expansion into Canada can be told in three parts<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Here the writer presents the reader with an overview of this section, introducing the three reasons that were identified in the outline."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> : high start-up and real estate costs, combined with an early peak in sales, exposed poor business planning and a lack of understanding of the Canadian market.</p>
                <h4>Unreasonable Costs<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The writer proceeds to discuss each reason more thoroughly, following the sequence identified in the outline."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></h4>
                <p>Krispy Kreme’s First attempt to expand into Canada failed due to unexpectedly high costs. Stores were too expensive to operate due to unexpectedly high upkeep and real estate costs. Stores were around 5000 square feet each (Harris, 2016, para. 3) and cost up to 2-3 million dollars to open (Shaw, 2016, para. 7).<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The writer has integrated the details that had been gathered in the outline. Notice how these two points have been combined in a logical way, even though they were listed separately in the outline."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> Such high fixed costs nullified revenue produced by these so called “factory outlets”, preventing Krispy Kreme’s typical sales model of relying almost exclusively on these types of stores for selling to consumers.</p><h4>Inconsistent Sales</h4>
                <p>Krispy Kreme’s first attempt to expand into Canada failed partly due to sales peaking early, resulting in overproduction amid rapid expansion. Sales of donuts were initially high, but not enough to justify costs as the businesses’ novelty wore off (Harris, 2016, para. 23). Sales declined rapidly after its first few years in Canada. “There was almost too much hype” according to Keith Stein, the chairman of Krispy Kreme Canada Incorporated (Wright, 2016, para. 5)</p><h4>Flawed Market Research</h4>
                <p>Another reason Krispy Kreme’s Canada expansion failed was their poor understanding of the Canadian market. Canadians do not eat as many donuts as Krispy Kreme believed, and competition was fierce (Harris, 2016, para. 21). The company did not make accurate projections of how its business model would do in Canada. For example, for Tim Hortons, Krispy Kreme’s primary competitor in the donut café industry in Canada, donuts make up only 7% of total sales (Harris, 2016, para. 14). Krispy Kreme quickly discovered that in order for a donut shop to succeed in Canada, it must offer more than just donuts.</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">B. Keys to a Successful Canadian Expansion</h3>
      <h4>Key to Success #1: Limiting Factory Outlets</h4>
      <p><strong>Topic Sentence:</strong> KK plans to successfully expand into the Canada by limiting its factory outlets to a small percentage of its total stores.<br>
      <strong>Explanation, proof, or example:</strong><ul>
      	<li>Open as few factory outlets as possible and only increase with low real estate costs (Wright, 2017) &rarr; this will avoid high start-up and operating costs</li>
      	<li>Lowering expenses &rarr; will help KK respond to unexpectedly high or low sales in other types of stores which will not produce their own donuts (Wright, 2017)</li>
      </ul></p>
      <h4>Key to Success #2: Using a Café Model</h4>
      <p><strong>Topic Sentence:</strong> Krispy Kreme plans to successfully expand into the Canada by relying primarily on a café-style store model.<br>
      <strong>Explanation, proof, or example:</strong><ul>
      	<li>Noticed that donut companies in Canada succeed under a café type business model &rarr; emphasizes selling coffee, providing a meeting place to consumers, more than just selling donuts (Wright, 2017).</li>
      	<li>Believes this new format has a lot of potential (CBC, 2016).</li>

      <h4>Key to Success #3: Exploiting Brand Power</h4>
      <p><strong>Topic Sentence:</strong> Krispy Kreme plans to successfully expand into the Canada by exploiting its brand power.<br>
      <strong>Explanation, proof, or example:</strong><ul>

This organization follows the pattern established in the outline."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></h3>
                <p>Despite their failed initial attempt, Krispy Kreme intends to give the Canadian market another try. However, their second effort will differ from the first in three major areas<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="As in the previous section, the writer has developed an introductory paragraph before they explore this sub-topic in more detail. This provides the reader with a big-picture understanding of what they are about to read."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>: the number of factories, the style of their stores, and the strategy of their marketing campaign.</p>
                <h4>Limiting Factory Outlets<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Notice how a Level Two Sub-heading is used to signal to the reader that this paragraph represents one aspect of Krispy Kreme’s plan for new expansion."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></h4>
                <p>Krispy Kreme plans to successfully expand into the Canada by limiting its factory outlets to a small percentage of its total stores. In response to the company’s unjustifiably high start-up and operating costs of its factory outlets in Canada, Krispy Kreme plans to open as few factory outlets as possible and only increase with low real estate costs (CBC, 2016, para .25). This will save the company money, and increase responsiveness to unexpectedly high or low sales in Krispy Kreme’s other types of stores which will not produce their own donuts (Wright, 2017, para.15).</p>
                <h4>Café Model</h4>
                <p>Krispy Kreme plans to successfully expand into the Canada by relying primarily on a café-style store model. Krispy Kreme has noticed that donut companies in Canada tend to succeed under a café type business model, which emphasizes selling coffee and providing a meeting place to consumers as much as it is concerned with selling donuts (Wright, 2017, para. 8). Krispy Kreme believes this new format has a lot of potential (CBC, 2016, para. 15). The company intends to implement a hub-and-spoke style system, where a limited number of factory outlets will produce donuts which will then be delivered to surrounding café-style outlets twice a day. This will drastically decrease average start-up and operating costs for Krispy Kreme’s stores in Canada.</p>
                <h4>Exploit Brand Power</h4>
                <p>Krispy Kreme plans to successfully expand into the Canada by exploiting its brand power. Krispy Kreme has experienced massive growth recently, with sales experiencing double digit growth for the last five years (Shaw, 2016, para. 2). The company believes it has retained its brand recognition in Canada (Wright, 2017, para. 16). According to Stein, “Millennials and young people embrace this brand and they seem to think it is cool” (Shaw, 2016. para. 19).<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This text reference was not included in the original outline.

Although your goal is to produce an outline that is detailed enough that you will not have to conduct any additional research, you may still find that your discussion needs more detail in particular places."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> Krispy Kreme will also use social media to grow its brand recognition (Wright, 2016, para. 16)</p>

      <h3 style="text-align: center;">C. Challenges Facing Krispy Kreme’s Expansion into Canada</h3>
      <h4>Challenge #1: Outside Core Competency</h4>
      <p><strong>Topic Sentence:</strong> Krispy Kreme has little experience running café-style shops on a large scale, so the company will be operating outside of its core competency.<br>
      <strong>Explanation, proof, or example:</strong><ul>
      	<li>Always relied on its ability to sell donuts to its customers right off the production line &rarr; maximum freshness</li>
      	<li>Planned model for Canada scraps that model, introduces a new one</li>
      	<li>Krispy Kreme has not yet proven it can run on a large scale </li>
      	<li>New model comes with new challenges &rarr; logistics of shipping donuts from store-to-store and selling large quantities of coffee</li>
      </ul></p>
      <h4>Challenge #2: Crowded Market</h4>
      <p><strong>Topic Sentence:</strong> Canada has the most donut shops in the world per capita, making the country’s donut market extremely fierce and competitive (CBC, 1994).<br>
      <strong>Explanation, proof, or example:</strong><ul>
      	<li>Canada’s donut market does not have much room left to grow</li>
      	<li>High demand is already met with high supply</li>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Challenges Facing New Expansion</h3>
                <p>Krispy Kreme’s revised plan for Canadian expansion is likely to be more successfully than the first, but the company should still expect to face significant obstacles. Two challenges in particular will need to be addressed if Krispy Kreme’s second run at the Canadian donut market is going to work: inexperience and competition.</p>
                <h4>Core Competency</h4>
                <p>Krispy Kreme has little experience running café-style shops on a large scale, so the company will be operating outside of its core competency. Krispy Kreme has always relied on its ability to sell donuts to its customers right off the production line, ensuring maximum freshness. The company’s planned model for Canada mostly scraps that model, and introduces a model, “dramatically different” from the Krispy Kreme of old” which the company has not yet proven it can run on a large scale (Harris, 2016, para. 9). This model comes with new challenges, namely the logistics of shipping donuts from store-to-store and selling large quantities of coffee.</p>
                <h4>Crowded Market</h4>
                <p>Canada has the most donut shops in the world per capita, making the country’s donut market extremely fierce and competitive (CBC, 1994, para 1). Canada’s donut market does not have much room left to grow, so the country’s massive demand is already met with exceptionally high supply, and features companies aggressively guarding their market share. According to Robert Carter of the NPD Group, a Canadian market research company, “the quick service restaurant market is flat. So, for the chain to grow, it will have to steal customers from competitors” (Harris, 2016, para. 29).</p>
                <p><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Notice how this section of the outline has been developed: the writer has decided that it was necessary to use two paragraphs, rather than one, to discuss these ideas clearly and logically."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>Krispy Kreme’s greatest competitor in Canada is Tim Hortons, which is Canada’s most influential brand and a cultural icon (Martin, 2016, para. 4). In fact, Tim Hortons is more than just a competing business; it has become an essential aspect of Canada’s national identity. If Krispy Kreme is to expand in Canada, it must wrestle customers away from Tim Hortons (Harris, 2016, para. 29), even though the company’s leaders have “no intention of growing aggressively and compet[ing] with Tim Hortons,” according to Stein (Shaw, 2016, para. 32). Still, the company will have to match Tim Hortons in quality and it will have to overcome Canadian patriotism, a tool which Tim Hortons tends to exploit as it protects its market dominance from newcomers.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Krispy Kreme learned some harsh lessons in its first foray into Canada. Between the high costs of opening and operating, the inconsistency of sales, and the difficulty in understanding Canada’s complex donut market, many believed the donut giant would accept their fate focus their business elsewhere, never to try to return to the country as a major retailer again. Luckily for the many Canadians who couldn’t get enough of the glazed icon, Krispy Kreme has decided to give Canada another taste of its business in another attempt to establish itself in the great white north, constructing its business model around Canada, using a hub-and-stoke system to increase efficiency.</p>
                <p>However, Krispy Kreme will continue to face challenging obstacles<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Notice how the writer summarizes key concepts without repeating any of the specific details"><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>: using an untested business model will likely expose unforeseen problems, and operating in an extremely crowded market will leave little margin for error. But if Krispy Kreme can exploit its opportunities and overcome its numerous obstacles, the prize may be worth the struggle. Even if the American donut giant is able to secure only a small fraction of the Canadian market – a far more likely outcome than a total domination of the existing competition – it should still consider the expansion successful. After all, in the donut capital of the world, even a Timbit’s worth of the market is still worth a lot.<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The writer has developed the major idea of the conclusion in more depth: that Krispy Kreme’s new expansion might lead to some success."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
