               <p><strong>Research Question:</strong><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The research question that appears here should reflect whatever recommendations your instructor has made in response to your proposal email. The research question does not necessarily need to appear in your final report, although it might contain information about the context of your research, which you may want your reader to know."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a><br>What particular innovations from Moog Music allowed it to influence synthesizers - and thus remain strongly relevant - in today’s music industry?</p>
               <p><strong>Working Thesis (answer to the question):</strong><br>Moog’s lasting success in the music industry can be attributed to these three main topics: innovative electronic engineering, layout and design, and high-profile collaborations/endorsements.<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Note that the thesis/ purpose statement is written in full sentence form (rather than point-form)."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
               <p><strong>Reason it matters - Introduction context:</strong><ul>
                   <li>Modern electronic instruments have helped to change the sounds heard in all sorts of media, to this day: music (many genres), movies, video games, etc.</li>
				   <li>Keith Emerson with Emerson, Lake and Palmer (Jenkins, 2007, p. 48)</li>
				   <li>Films such as Blade Runner (Lendino, 2012, para. 1)</li>
				   <li>There is one brand, among many others, that seems to be credited with defining the ‘synthesized’ sound: Moog </li>
				   <li>Why is this? What did founder Robert Moog do to synthesizers, specifically, that had such a lasting effect on the music industry?<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The outline should contain the ideas and information that you’ll use in your introductory paragraph. Notice how this writer establishes a broad context for the discussion (electronic instruments) and then focuses on one particular aspect of this topic (Moog synthesizers)."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></li></ul></p>
			  <h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Innovative Electronic Engineering<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This is the first Level 1: Heading. (See {insert quicklink to topic: Organizing an Outline in week 11} if you want a refresher on the formatting or the use of headings.) This section lacks a general introduction. Notice how the next level 1: heading section (titled “Layout and Design Layout”) is discussed in a general way before it is broken down into sub-topics."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></strong></h5>
			  <p><strong>Strong Academic Background in Electronics - Robert Moog</strong><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="First use of Level 2: Subheading. Note the formatting and how the content follows in point-form."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>constructed his first Theremin instrument at age 14, later sold Theremin kits to pay for education (“Building on the Legacy”, 2013, p.118)</li>
			  	<li>completed a degree in electrical engineering at Columbia University, as well as a Ph.D. at Cornell University (“Building on the Legacy”, 2013, p.119)</li>
			  </ul></p>
		      <p><strong>Voltage-Controlled Modulation</strong>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>can be regulated in a circuit consistently; makes any sort of adjustments easier for achieving desired sound (Jenkins, 2007, p.49)</li>
			  	<li>e.g., compared to dependency on capacitance or current from earlier engineers, which is heavily influenced by temperature, humidity, etc. (Jenkins, 2007, p.50)<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This writer has already identified the factual information that will support their analysis and inform their reader. They have also cited the sources of their research, which will ensure that their final report is correctly documented."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></li>
			  	<li>Moog’s patents made his products much more highly desired, at this early stage (Jenkins, 2007, p. 49)</li>
			  	<li>released first ‘modular synthesizer’ in 1964 (McNamee, 2010, para. 2)</li>
			  	<li>demonstrated work at 1964 New York Audio Engineering Show Convention (“Building on the Legacy”, 2013, p.120)</li>
			  	<li>introduced enough customers to seriously start business</li>
			  </ul></p>
			  <h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Layout and Design Layout</strong></h5>
			  <ul>
			  <li>important for how users interface with oscillator modulation
			  <ul>
			  	<li>synths such as Minimoog helped to establish what would be considered standard ‘signal path’ (Jenkins, 2007, p. 50) </li>
			  </ul></li>
		      <li>developed a straight-forward layout for sound manipulation (Lendino, 2012, para. 3):
			  <ul>
			  	<li>signal generators (oscillators, pink/white noise)<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Notice how this writer uses indentation to organize ideas. When the writer is ready to write the report, they’ll be able to see the difference between supporting points and examples."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></li>
			  	<li>filter (harmonics, resonance)</li>
			  	<li>amplifier (ADSR: attack, decay, sustain, release)</li>
			  </ul></li>
			  <li>addition of ‘mod-wheel’ (used to modulate pitch) would soon become standard on synths from future companies (“Building on the Legacy”, 2013, p.121)</li>
			  <li>allowed users to achieve what seemed like an endless combinations of possible tones</li>
			  <li>collaboration with Herbert Deutsch allowed implementation of keyboard layout on Moog’s synths (Jenkins, 2007, p.51)
			  	<ul><li>allowed much easier use for regular musicians </li></ul>
			  </li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><strong>Design</strong>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>many early synths required complex, manual cable patching for individual components (Jenkins, 2007, p. 53)
			  	<ul><li>for some, this was a turn-off as it could become very complicated</li></ul></li>
			  	<li>models such as Minimoog came pre-patched (Jenkins, 2007, p.53)
			  	<ul>
			  	<li>no manual patching with lots of confusing cases</li>
			  	<li>perfect for average musician looking to easily incorporate synth sounds into work</li></ul></li>
			  </ul></p>
			  <p><strong>Pricing</strong>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>early synthesizers, including Moog’s 1964 modular synth, were relatively expensive for the time; outside the budget of most musicians (McNamee, 2010, para. 4)</li>
			  	<li>Minimoog pricing was manageable; allowed musicians </li>
			  	<li>1970s: with marketing, got Minimoog products into more general music stores, rather than specialty electronic stores (Jenkins, 2007, p. 55)</li>
			  </ul></p>
		      <p><strong>Minimoog</strong><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This outline already uses headings and sub-headings to organize ideas and information. When the writer is ready to write the report, they can keep write sections out of order, if they want to, rather than writing from beginning to end, without getting lost. This flexibility is valuable because it’s common for a writer to discover that some sections are easier to write than others; rather than getting stuck on one “tough” section”, you can skip it and come back to it later."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>considered by many to be the main contributing factor to Moog’s legacy ‐ came out on the market in 1970; sold 13,000 units over ten years (“Building on the Legacy”, 2013, p.122)</li>
			  	<li>iconic sound, design, portability, and affordability</li>
			  </ul></p>
			  <h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>High-Profile Collaborations/Endorsements</strong></h5>
			  <p><strong>Collaborations with Academics</strong>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Moog’s work caught the attention of Herbert Deutsch and Walter (later Wendy) Carlos<br>
			  	<strong>Herbert Deutsch</strong><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Note the first use of Level 3: Subheading."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>
			  	<ul><li>professor of music at Hofstra University  (“Building on the Legacy”, 2013, p. 124)</li>
			  	<li>later became marketing manager for Moog</li>
			  	<li>collaborated with Moog to implement keyboard layout design (Jenkins, 2007, p. 52)</li></ul>
			  	<strong>Walter (Wendy) Carlos</strong>
			  	<ul><li>music and electronics student at Columbia-Princeton</li>
			  	<li>collaborated with Moog while in school to make changes to existing modules</li>
			  	<li>early Moog synths were monophonic, playing only one note at a time (no chords)</li>
			  	<li>helped to establish multi-track techniques, using recorders, to achieve multiphonic sounds (Jenkins, 2007, p. 57)</li>
			  	<li>in 1968, released Switched on Bach (McNamee, 2010, para. 2)
			  	<ul>
			  	<li>funding from CBS allowed Carlos to record an entire album of classical music using synthesizers; used Moog’s modular synths (Jenkins, 2007, p. 57)</li>
			  	<li>album became widely critically acclaimed; directly contributed to expansion of synthesizer awareness with both major labels and independent artists (Jenkins, 2007, p. 57)</li></ul></li>
			  	</ul></li>
			  </ul></p>
			  <p><strong>Collaborations with High-Profile Musicians<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Notice that there are only two sub-categories (Level 2: Subheading) in this major section (titled “High-Profile Collaborations/Endorsements”), while the previous section contained three sub-categories. That’s okay! One advantage of using headings and sub-headings to organize your research is that allows you to be flexible in your organization, without sacrificing clarity."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></strong>
			  <ul>
			  	<li>Artists: Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman, Jan Hammer, Mick Jagger (Jenkins, 2007, p. 58)
			  	<ul>
			  		<li>Keith Emerson is often noted as the first to use Moog synths in live performance; helped bring significant exposure to mainstream audience (Jenkins, 2007, p. 58)</li>
			  	</ul></li>
			  	<li>Bands: The Doors, The Monkees, The Byrds
			  	<ul><li>Hits such as Hot Butter’s Popcorn, and Space’s Magic Fly make notable use of Moog synths (McNamee, 2010, para. 7)</li></ul></li>
			  </ul></p>
			   <h5 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h5>
			  <ul>
			    <li>Moog’s early work helped to define the synthesizer we know today, in all sorts of media</li>
			  	<li>legacy can be contributed by these three main points<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Notice how the conclusion summarizes the main points of the report without repeating them word-for-word. Instead, the writer seems to have re-packaged these ideas in a way that highlights key ideas."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>
			  	<ul><li>research and patents on voltage-control parameters</li>
			  	<li>innovative sound, design, layout, and portability; most recognized from the Minimoog</li>
			  	<li>collaborations and endorsements from many professional academics and highprofile musicians; Walter (Wendy) Carlos’ <em>Switched on Bach</em> put the Moog sound on the map.</li></ul></li>
			  	<li>it is said that innovation comes from standing on the shoulders of giants
			  	<ul><li>current electronic music instrument designers stand on the shoulders of Moog... and it’s hopefully clearer to see why, now</li>
			  	<li>important for future electronic music instrument designers to know<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The conclusion also looks forward and considers how the information contained in the report might be used by others and/or why this information is important to know."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> their ‘origins’; hopefully know where to go with this past innovation in mind.</li></ul></li>
			  </ul>

Not only will this save the writer time later on, but it can also help to reveal whether the writer has consulted a sufficient number and variety of sources, while there is still time to conduct further research."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></strong></h5>
