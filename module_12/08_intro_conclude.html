        <h1>Introductory and Concluding Sections</h1>
        <p>Our exploration of outlines has focused on your claims and the support for your claims – in other words, the body paragraphs. But your comprehensive outline should also consider the introductory and concluding sections of your research project.</p>
        <p>Because the scope of this project is bigger than your previous writing assignments in this course, the introductory and concluding sections of your research project will likely require more depth and detail.</p>
        <p>The best way to ensure that your research is effectively introduced and reinforced, gather and analyze the relevant information at this outline stage. Use the same tools and techniques that you’ve used for the rest of the outline: e.g. headings and sub-headings, point-form writing style, bullet points and lists.</p>
        <h3>Introductory Paragraph</h3>
        <p>
        	Help your reader prepare for the challenge of absorbing and retaining the information you’re about to present. Use this space to establish the context for your report by presenting them with the background that they need to have: 
        	<ul>
        		<li>Definitions that must be understood to participate in the discussion</li>
        		<li>Events that led to the current situation</li>
        		<li>Reasons to care or be concerned about the topic or problem being addressed</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
        <p>Optional: Review our first exploration of introductory paragraphs in Week 5: <a href="">insert quicklink to topic: Introductory Paragraphs</a></p>
        <p>Review the following student examples of an outline for an introductory paragraph. Notice how the student plans to draw in the reader.</p>

            <p><strong>Research question:</strong> What characteristics should a consumer look for in selecting the best intelligent personal assistant? <br><strong>Thesis statement:</strong> To identify the best voice assistant on the market, a consumer should consider: the accuracy of the assistant’s response to search queries, the source of the assistant’s information, and the clarity of the assistant’s delivery.<br><strong>Introductory information:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Speech Recognition began in 1950s: Bell Laboratories
            <ul>
				<li>could only understand single spoken digits (Pinola, 2011, para. 3)</li>
				</ul></li>
            <li>Developed quickly 
            	<ul>
				<li>1962: IBM, “Shoebox” &rarr; could understand 16 English words (Pinola, 2011, para. 3)</li>
				<li>1970s: American military, universities produced machine with vocabulary equal to a 3-year-old: over 1000 words (Pinola, 2011, para. 4)</li>
				<li>1980s: used in dolls and toys (Pinola, 2011, para. 5)</li>
				<li>1990s: first consumer speech recognition product, Dragon Naturally Speaking (Pinola, 2011, para. 6)</li>
				</ul>
            </li>
            <li>Major breakthrough: development of voice recognition had stalled until Google 2010, Siri &rarr; used the cloud to perform search more quickly, predict speech, be more accurate (Pinola, 2011, para. 8)</li>
            <li>Now &rarr; intelligent personal assistant found on nearly every brand of smartphone</li>
            <li>Microsoft, Apple, and Google &rarr; leading the industry </li>
            <li>Variety of choice creates new problem for customer &rarr; how to choose?</li>
            <li>Should base choice on three factors: 
            <ul>
				<li>accuracy of the assistant’s response to search queries</li>
				<li>source of the assistant’s information, and</li>
				<li>clarity of the assistant’s delivery.</li>
				</ul></li>

        <h3>Concluding Section</h3>
         <p>
        	Your concluding thoughts can and should aim to do more than simply recap or summarize what you’ve already presented in the body of your paper. Instead, use this space to help your reader understand what they should do with this information:
        	<ul>
        		<li>Why does it matter? What are the implications of your findings?</li>
        		<li>How can we use this information to help us solve a problem or answer a question?</li>
        		<li>What problems still remain? What questions still need to be answered?</li>
        	</ul>
        </p>
        <p>Optional: Review our first exploration of concluding paragraphs in Week 5: <a href="">insert quicklink to topic: Concluding Paragraphs</a></p>
        <p>Review the following student examples of an outline for a concluding section. Notice how the student leaves the reader with coming trends.</p>

            <p><strong>Research question:</strong> Could a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin become a viable functioning currency? <br><strong>Thesis:</strong> Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin meet the three criteria of currency: medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value<br><strong>Conclusion:</strong>
            <ul>
            <li>Meets criteria for currency &rarr; BUT: three obstacles to overcome
            <ul>
				<li>Lack of widespread public acceptance: people are hesitant</li>
				<li>Limitation of supply: will make cost of currency rise, limit its widespread use</li>
				<li>Lack of government regulation: could make currency volatile, risky</li>
				</ul></li>
            <li>Recent trends suggest these concerns are being addressed:  
            	<ul>
				<li>Bitcoin daily transaction volumes &rarr; increased 50% from early 2016 (Coindesk, 2016, Chart section).</li>
				<li>Newer cryptocurrencies adding to supply: e.g. Ethereum &rarr; increasing available units, 18 million per year (Ethereum, 2016, FAQ section, para 2).  </li>
				<li>Canada: Bill C-31 &rarr; “world’s first national law on digital currencies...under [the] national anti-money laundering law” (Duhaime, 2014. para.1).  </li>
				</ul>
            </li>
            <li>Only a matter of time before cryptocurrencies become as widely accepted as debit and credit card transactions are today 
            <ul>
				<li>Regulators and providers need to work together to advance the field, address public concerns </li>
				<li>Consumers &rarr; be an early adopter and profit!</li>
				</ul></li>
