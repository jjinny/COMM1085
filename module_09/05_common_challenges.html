        <h1>Common Challenges with Critical Reflection </h1>
        <img src="images/common_challenge.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1-half" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" />
        <p>Now that we have identified both the value of critical reflection and a few potential models for doing it, it’s important to also identify a few common challenges that students commonly face when attempting this kind of writing.</p>
        <h2>I’m not sure what I’m doing / I don’t feel confident</h2>
        <p>Reflection isn’t easy but becomes easier by practicing! Developing reflective capacity is a process that requires time and patience. Bruce (as cited in Write Online, n.d.), for instance, says that reflective capacity has long-term significance. This will be particularly useful for you as you enter the professional world.</p>
        <p>It can also be comforting to remember that your audience in this kind of writing is — largely — just you. The stakes here are relatively low.</p>
        <h2>I don’t have the time / I can’t find a place to reflect</h2>
        <p>Critical reflection can seem like a time-consuming exercise because it can be difficult to force meaningful reflection — you may need to let your thoughts come together over time before you can develop constructive insights.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, it can be challenging to conduct this kind of inward thinking when you’re in a public place, like an office, a dorm, or a school cafeteria or library.</p>
        <p>One way to address both of these concerns is to begin your reflection well ahead of the due date, and then allow yourself to reflect in those “quiet moments” that present themselves throughout the day — in the shower or in front of the mirror, in the car or on your bike, with your headphones on when you’re riding the bus.</p>
        <p>After you’ve completed this kind of preliminary reflection, you can record them on paper as point-form notes and then proceed to develop those notes as you would with any other assignment.</p>
        <h2>It’s difficult or uncomfortable to critically examine my own work, work habits, and beliefs</h2>
        <p>This is perhaps the greatest obstacle of all. One way to address this challenge is to remind yourself that this kind of self-reflection and self-assessment is a key component of self-improvement. Think of it like exercising or practicing a musical instrument — it can be grueling at times, but it feels good afterward when you can recognize your own growth.</p>
