        <h1>Evaluating Sources with the CARS Tool</h1>
        <p>There are a number of criteria that can be used to evaluate the quality and credibility of a source of information. One popular method for remembering the various characteristics to look for is the CARS evaluation system.</p>
        <h3>Credibility</h3><p>Look for believable, well written information that is free of bias. Locate information about the author(s) and their credentials. How credible are the authors, what is their level of expertise on this particular topic?</p>
        <h3>Accuracy</h3><p>The information should be up-to-date and clear. You can confirm accuracy by locating information from a variety of sources. Look for a last updated date.</p>
        <h3>Relevance</h3><p>The information should contribute to your knowledge on the topic you are researching. It should support your thesis/research question or offer a substantial counter point. It should be written at a level appropriate for inclusion in your research. If a source is too academic it may use unknown terminology and discuss topics that are too advanced for your level of study. If a source is too popular or too basic, it may not be academic or professional enough to be of value for your purposes.</p>
		<h3>Support</h3><p>Other sources should support the information found. Always look for a reference list, bibliography or citations demonstrating where the information came from.</p>
       
        <h2><i class="fal fa-question-circle fa-lg text-second fa-pull-left"></i> Knowledge Check</h2>
		<p>Use this system with the checklist in the next topic page to rank the following three sources from most reliable to least. Use all the information provided in the reference to track down and evaluate the source.</p>

              <p><strong>“Science shows that eSports professionals are real athletes”</strong> is in a publication based in Germany, and the publication provides many indications that it is a legitimate news publication. For example, if we select the <a href="http://www.dw.com/en/about-dw/profile/s-30688" title="http://www.dw.com/en/about-dw/profile/s-30688" target="_blank">About Us tab</a>, we can identify many characteristic features of legitimate and reliable news organization: <ul>
              	<li>A proven track record </li>
              	<li>A large distribution and readership </li>
              	<li>Large, organized, and transparent governing bodies, such as administrative and editorial boards </li>
              	<li>Links to well-maintained social media accounts</li>
              </ul></p>
              <p>Although the <strong>Wikipedia entry on “Sports”</strong> is very thorough and well-documented, it’s been assembled by amateur contributors working independently of one another. This means that while the information is likely factually accurate, the selection and interpretation of that information may be unreliable. Rather than citing this Wikipedia entry, you can use it to become familiar with the topic. Make notes of terminology and important names that you can use to enhance your search of the library database. </p>
              <p>You could also follow the references provided at the bottom of the page to access the original sources cited by the Wikipedia authors. While some of the sources may be more authoritative than others, you can apply the criteria we’ve been discussing this week to determine which are most reliable.</p>
              <p>Finally, <strong>eSports are Real Sports</strong> has several features of an unreliable source: <ul>
			  <li>First, <a href="http://factmyth.com/author/jordans/" title="http://factmyth.com/author/jordans/" target="_blank">the author’s bio</a> offers little to suggest he is qualified to claim authority on this subject: we learn he is a student but are not provided with any details of his education, experience, or credentials; further, he provides no contact information or any way to confirm his real identity other than the name he provides.</li>
              	<li>Next, a review of the references found at the bottom of the page reveals that the author has used dubious or biased sources, such as redbull.com and esportsify.com</li>
			  <li>Finally, a look at the <a href="http://factmyth.com/about/" title="http://factmyth.com/about/" target="_blank">About Us page</a> reveals a small and non-professional editorial team, without any track-record or industry credentials to reinforce their credibility.</li>
              </ul></p>
