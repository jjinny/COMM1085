        <h1>Reflecting on Instructor’s Feedback</h1>
      <p>Now that we have discussed the benefits and types of critical reflection in general, we can turn our attention to the specific practice of using reflection to improve your academic writing. In this week’s “Feedback Journal” assignment, you will be asked to review the feedback you have received from your instructor on two different writing assignments. The feedback journal requires you to document your reflection in two ways:<ul>
      	<li>Summarize the feedback you received on the two assignments you selected </li>
      	<li>Identify steps that you can take to apply what you’ve learned from this feedback on your remaining COMM1085 assignments </li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>The insight you will gain from these observations and the focus you will generate from these goals will, together, provide a strong foundation for the work that you will do in the coming weeks to develop and complete the Research Project assignment.</p>
      <h2>Feedback Journal Model</h2>
      <p>Let’s begin our work on the Feedback Journal by looking at some of the assessment criteria that outline the expectations for this assignment. An excellent reflection will:<ul>
      	<li>Summarize your instructor’s feedback in your own words</li>
      	<li>Make relevant connections or identify trends in the feedback you’ve received</li>
      	<li>Create a clear and meaningful action plan based on the feedback</li>
      	<li>Demonstrate your ability to ask meaningful questions about your own work </li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>The following student sample illustrates further what a meaningful and thorough feedback journal looks like. To see a detailed discussion of this student’s work, click on each <i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" title="eye"></i> icon.</p>

      <h3>Sample Feedback Journal</h3>
      <p>My professor thought that my article summary was generally strong overall due to its organization and the fact that the paraphrasing was to the point as is required with a summary <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="By identifying the expectations of the assignment, this student is demonstrating their learning in an authentic way."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>. Aside from some basic formatting errors as well as simple/careless grammatical errors <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="By bringing together several individual comments on formatting and grammar, this student has effectively paraphrased."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>, he notes that I should be more careful with how I transition between ideas and focus on really highlighting the author’s main argument.</p>
      <p>In terms of my analytical writing paper, my professor thought that it was focused correctly and that I expressed my ideas in an understandable way. However<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This student focuses on both strengths and weaknesses in their work, which enriches the depth of their reflection."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>, he did note that I needed to hone in at the paragraphs and focus on developing my ideas past a basic level to make the reader feel like I had considered any questions or opposing ideas that they may have.</p>
      <p>Between the two assignments it seems that I need to really focus on the main idea of the writing, whether it’s expressing the main idea of someone else’s work or developing the main idea of my own. I’m not exactly sure if I had made improvements because my grade on the second assignment was lower than the first, but it was the more difficult assignment. I think that really expressing my ideas in a thorough way is going to be my greatest challenge<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The student attempts to draw “big-picture” insights from particular situations. This might help them to develop a more effective action plan going forward."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>.</p>
      <p>I thought that I had done well on the summary so it was encouraging<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This student also considers how they felt about the nature of the work and the feedback they received. Taking stock of emotions is an important part of a productive reflection."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> to see that my professor thought the same thing. In the future I’ll be able to use this knowledge to write summaries in a similar way but I’ll have to make sure that I really focus on emphasizing the author’s main idea.</p>
      <p>After writing my analytical paper I thought that I had laid out my ideas well and had fully built upon them. After going through it again with my professor’s feedback in mind I realize<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="It’s clear from this section that the student is willing to re-examine their work based on the feedback. This open-mindedness will help them to continue the learning."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a> that in many cases I only stated an idea (such as simply saying that an OS must be chosen) or slightly discussed it but didn’t go past surface level to develop it and fully explain what I wanted to express to the reader (when I brought in an external professional opinion but didn’t offer my own analysis for example). In all future writing assignments, I will make sure to expand upon all of my key points and be very thorough when checking through papers before I submit them to ensure that I am successful in this. Based on the recent feedback for my persuasive writing paper I believe that I’m headed in the right direction <a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The student is looking for ways to make connections between previous work and current or ongoing work. This is great because it demonstrates they understand this course is a continuous process of development."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>.</p>
      
      <p>Aside from performing my own check for simple grammatical and formatting errors I think that having a friend read my papers would be a good way to catch undeveloped ideas because I find that when I write I end up missing some things because I’ll think of them, but not write them down.</p>
