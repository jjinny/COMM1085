        <p>Your brainstorm has likely helped you to explore your interests and identify a specific focus. However, before you proceed with this week’s assignment (the proposal), you should check that your research question is appropriately constructed.</p>
        <p>Last week we learned that research questions need to have an appropriate scope if the project is going to be successful. This video explains how to define a research question.</p>

              <p class="mt-2">If your research question requires you to consider too much information, your research will take too long and you will struggle to include everything in a paper of this length. Such a research question would be <strong>too broad</strong>: “Why do people drive electric cars?”</p>
              <p>At the same time, if the focus of your question is too specific, it can limit your research options and you might struggle to produce the length and depth expected in this assignment. Such a research question would be <strong>too narrow</strong>: “How many Ontario drivers prefer electric cars over other types of cars because they like how they look?”</p>
              <p>Here are some other research question pitfalls to avoid:<ul>
              	<li>Closed questions</li>
              	<li>Subjective questions</li>
              	<li>Leading questions</li>
              	<li>Asking multiple questions</li>

				<p>If a question can be completely addressed with a short and simple answer, then it is closed and you will need to approach the topic from a different perspective.

              <p>If a question can only be addressed by drawing on your own personal and subjective opinion, then it needs to be revised. Avoid asking a question for which you already have an answer, as you risk turning the research project into a search for reasons to defend your opinion. Watch out for questions that would require you to make an evaluation or conclusion based on the way something looks, sounds, or tastes, or questions about personal preferences.</p>

              <p>It’s impossible to answer this question objectively because video game preferences are highly subjective. It’s also not a suitable research question because it doesn’t seem to have any professional applications. It’s the kind of question friends might discuss or debate in their spare time.</p>
              <p>Potential solution: Steer your preferences toward your profession. Instead of defending your personal preferences, look to understand them. What are the characteristics that matter most? What criteria should we use to evaluate or compare? By expanding your focus and looking at your personal interest through a professional lens, you can build toward your dream career.</p>

              <p>If a question includes an idea that is based on personal preference or assumption rather than observable facts, then it’s likely to undermine the rest of your research. Watch for words that are often based on value judgements, like best / worst and most / least.</p>

                    <p>Question: Why is Amazon the most influential business in the world today?</p>

However, there are many influential companies at work throughout the world, and this question mistakenly assumes that everyone would agree Amazon is the most influential.</p>
              <p>Potential solution: Question your own assumptions. While it wouldn’t be wise to ask “Which company is the most influential in the world?”, because it would be difficult to objectively measure a company’s influence, you could certainly attempt to look more closely at Amazon’s influence.</p>

					<p>This pitfall is similar to the question that is too broad. It’s common for students to propose answering multiple questions when they’ve been given the freedom to choose a topic that interests them personally and professionally. You can easily see when you have asked too many questions because you will see multiple question marks. Also watch out for a question that includes more than one “question” word.</p>
