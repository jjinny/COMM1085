        <h1>The Purpose of an Outline</h1>
        <img src="images/purpose.jpg" class="img-fluid z-depth-1 pattern-1" style="margin-bottom: 15px;" />
        <p>The audience for this outline is different from the audience for your final research paper. Although you will eventually present your research to whomever has asked for it or needs it — a client, a manager, shareholders, etc. — the end-user of an outline is actually you, the writer! It is an internal, working document that only you will use as you work toward the finished product. Let’s explore the role of this document in the process of writing a document based on research.</p>
        <p>Producing an outline before you begin to write a first draft allows you to improve both the process and the outcome of your work because it isolates two different kinds of work. This gathering and organizing stage is an essential component of any production process.</p>

				<p><strong>Preparing an outline</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Looking for information </li>
					<li>Evaluating ideas </li>
					<li>Organizing ideas</li>
				</ul>
				Preparing an outline is similar to writing an inter-office memo: it’s a working document meant to inform and guide the ongoing progress of a project.  As you gather the information needed to answer your question, the outline becomes a place where you can store and sort that information. It is concerned with answering the question or solving the problem. Its primary focus is to build a structure that will stand or a machine that works.</p>

				<p><strong>Writing a first draft</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Looking for the right words, phrasing </li>
					<li>Achieving clarity, persuasiveness</li>
					</ul>
					Writing a first draft is, instead, looking out to your audience, to communicate to others what you’ve found. Its primary focus is cosmetic: to decorate the structure in a way that is inviting and comfortable or to market the machine in a way that is appealing.</p>

        <p>You can compare writing a paper to cooking. Before a professional chef begins to assemble a dish, they will first ensure that they have prepared all of the ingredients that they will need: laid out before them they will have the ingredients washed and cut and portioned so that the actual cooking consists mostly of combining the ingredients according to the directions.</p>
        <p>This preparation allows the chef to avoid costly interruptions. Imagine if they had to stop what they were doing so they could run to the market, buy a missing ingredient, and cut it into the appropriate size. It would certainly make for a less enjoyable cooking experience. It might also affect the quality of the dish, as the rest of the food sits waiting. Outlines do the same thing for writers.</p>

				<p><strong>Apply to the Job</strong><br>
				Think about the role that preparation and planning plays in your professional life. 
				<ul>
					<li>Where does your profession require preparation in advance?</li>
					<li>What does this preparation look like?</li>
					<li>What is a possible consequence of not preparing in advance?</li>
				</ul>
				From this perspective, the purpose of an outline is clear: to help you ensure that your paper will achieve its goal and that it has the information it needs to answer your question accurately and thoroughly.</p>
