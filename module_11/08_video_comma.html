        <p>Knowing when and where a comma is needed in a sentence can be one of the most troublesome aspects of writing for many students.</p>
		<ul><li>Perhaps you feel confident about their use in certain places, but not in others.</li>
			 <li>Perhaps you have been given non-technical strategies, such as: “use a comma when you want to create a pause in your writing.”</li>
			 <li>Or maybe you’re completely unsure about their use and you feel like you’re simply shaking them on your writing like sprinkles on an ice cream sundae.</li></ul>
            <p>We have already seen in week 5 how we use commas to separate dependent clauses from independent clauses and how commas work with the FANBOYS conjunctions (For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So) to separate independent clauses. For some good memory tricks about how commas work here, watch this video.</p>

              <p>"When you want to list several nouns in a sentence, you separate each word with a comma. This allows the reader to pause after each item and identify which words are included in the grouping. When you list items in a sentence, put a comma after each noun, then add the word and before the last item.” (Writing for Success, Chapter 3.1, “Commas in a List of Items”)"</p>

                   The renovation plans included upgrades to the cafeteria, library, welcome centre and athletic centre.</p>
              </div>
              <p>Both examples are correct. The only difference between the two sentences is the comma after <em>welcome centre</em>. This final comma in a series (known as the “serial” or “Oxford” comma) is optional but often used. In certain cases, the meaning of a sentence is ambiguous if the serial comma is not used.</p>
              <p>Imagine, for example, that a pop star wins an award, and, in the news the following day, the report notes her acceptance speech: <strong>She thanked her parents, Taylor Swift and Kanye West.</strong> Without the comma after “Taylor Swift”, the sentence is ambiguous.</p>
              <ul>
              	<li>One possible interpretation is that the pop star thanked only two people — her mother (Taylor Swift) and her father (Kanye West). This interpretation is correct if the pop star’s parents are Taylor Swift and Kanye West.</li>
              	<li>The other possible interpretation is that the pop star thanked four people — her two parents and the two other pop stars.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Using the serial comma, on the other hand, removes any ambiguity about the meaning of the sentence: <strong>She thanked her parents, Taylor Swift, and Kanye West.</strong></p>
              <ul><li>According to this punctuation, the only possible interpretation is that the pop star thanked four people — her two parents and the two other pop stars.</li></ul>
