  <p>Take the following paragraph and create an outline for it. The paragraph belongs in a report that attempts to answer: “What kind of impact smart technology is having on the modern home.”</p>
  	<p>Writing an outline is different from writing a draft of a paper. In fact, it might be more accurate to think of it as a sorting exercise rather than a writing exercise. The goal is to put relevant pieces of information into logical groups. We can use headings and sub-headings to help us organize our groups of information. The headings and sub-headings act like “buckets” or folders that we can use to contain the information that we acquire.</p>
  	<p>When we have headings and sub-headings organized in advance, we’re able to search for information freely. It’s no longer necessary to start with the introduction and force ourselves to work from top to bottom. Instead, we can simply place information in the appropriate location as the information becomes available.</p>
  	<p>Consistent styles for the different levels of headings makes it easier to see the difference between major sections and minor sections. APA@Conestoga outlines how to format each level. To see the formatting requirements for each, click the <i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" title="eye"></i> icon.</p>

  <p>For sections of the same importance, use the same level of heading. By putting information in the appropriate place, you can see when you have gathered enough information to sufficiently explain what you’re trying to say. It also becomes easier for you to ensure that you have presented your ideas logically. If the connections between ideas are unclear, you can rearrange them or add explanations to clarify the relationship between them.</p></div>

  <h2>Activity: Complete an Outline</h2>
  <p>Let’s practice organizing an outline. You will see a partially completed outline below. All the content (headings, subheadings and sentences) has been provided for you in a textbox to complete the outline yourself. To see how the completed portion of the outline operates and to find tips on how to complete the activity, click on each <i class="fa fa-eye" aria-hidden="true" title="eye"></i> icon.</p>

           <p>SHOPPING FOR HEALTH<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="This is the title of the paper and will be in the header of each page in all caps. You don’t need to format the header for this exercise."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
           <p>The products around the periphery of a supermarket are the healthiest. To ensure that you are bringing home the ingredients you need for a nutritious and balanced diet, focus your grocery shopping on these two categories: produce and proteins.<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="In your outline, the thesis is the first element. The text should be indented at one standard tab space. Include any information that belongs in the introduction here."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
           <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Plenty of Produce</strong><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Level 1: Heading is used here for the first category of shopping for health. As you organize the other elements, determine which has the same importance as this heading."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
           <p>Usually the produce section is the first areas a shopper enters…<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="The level 1 heading is followed by a sentence that introduces the overall category. So, for example, it would be important to discuss produce in general before dividing the category into fruits and vegetables. This introduction would highlight the sections that will be discussed (e.g., “Produce consists of fruits and vegetables”) and perhaps explain why they are so important to this analysis. The text should be indented at one standard tab space."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
           <p><strong>Many Kinds of Fruit</strong><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Level 2: Subheading is used here to inform the reader that the general discussion of produce is going to shift to a more specific discussion of one particular kind of produce, i.e., fruit. As you organize the other elements, determine which has the same importance as this heading. It is important to note that there will be more than one Level 2 Subheading. For example, it would be illogical to separate the category of “Produce” into a sub-category of “Fruits” if there were no other sub-categories to discuss. If that were the case, then we would need to identify “Fruits” as the Level 1 Heading."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
           <p>The abundance and variety of fruit available throughout the year…<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Each level 2 subheading is followed by a few sentences that introduce this sub-category. These sentences play the same role as the sentences that we wrote beneath the Level 1: Heading: they introduce the focus of this section, identifying the names of whatever sub-categories will follow, and they provide contextual information that will help the reader to understand what they are about to read. "><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
           <ul><p><strong>Apple varieties.</strong><a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Level 3: Subheading is used here to identify individual aspects or kinds of the sub-category identified in the Level 2: Subheading. When you edit the text below, bold the text that you want in level 3 subheading style. As you organize the other elements, determine which has the same importance as this heading."><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a>Although there are several types of apples available in most supermarkets, three varieties are found most consistently.<a data-toggle="tooltip" title="Each level 3 subheading is followed by a sentence that explains and discusses that sub-topic. No “introductory” discussion is needed here because this concept will not be further sub-divided. "><i class="fas fa-eye text-third"></i></a></p>
